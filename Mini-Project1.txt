You must have at least 10 substantive commits per group member that are marked "feature".  Any fixes to "features" must be marked as fixes and do not count.  Commits for creating files or renaming files or other non-feature work should be named "task".  
Commit message Examples:
Feature:  Added definition of the term repository.
Fix: Updated definition of repository
Task: Uploaded an image screenshot for a repository
Testing - Created a new branch
Project Description
For this project, you need to explain how the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company.  Your group also needs to have 2-3 (depending on group size) sections about the following topics:  
You must explain the gitFlow (Links to an external site.) workflow and have a section to define and give examples of how to use the following Git commands and terminology:
##WORK ON THESE COMMANDS##

What is a Repository?
A Repository is the git folder inside a project. This Repository must have a name and a description which tracks all changes made to the files in the project. I also realize that all these changes made within the project file builds a history ovwhich tracks all changes made to the files in the project. I also realize that all these changes made within the project file builds a history ovetime. Meaning, if you delete the .git/ folder, then you delete your project history
 
**Repository**:
After Git has been installed and configured, next is to put Git in the appropriate condition to start its operation. That is asking Git to start tracking changes in a particular project. We need to however decide where to put the project for Git to start tracking. This location is called a Repository. The repository can be a new folder created in a Windows directory on a Desktop.


The folder can be accessed via the command line by changing in to the windows directory in which that folder was created. Once in the root of the folder via the command Line, entering - Git init will tell Git to get everything ready to start doing its tracking.

A repository can also be created in the User Interface from the home screen after signing into your account, and then selecting 'New' or the 'Plus' sign (+) on the top right corner of the home page. See file attachment called 'Create a new repository.

What is Cloning in a Git?
Cloning is a process of creating an identical copy of a Git Remote Repository for a Project
When we clone a repository, all the files are downloaded to the local master but the remote git repository remains unchanged. Making changes and committing them on your local repository (cloned repository) will not affect the remote repository that you cloned in any way. These changes made on the local master can be synced with the remote repository anytime the user wants.

Why and how we Clone a Repository or a Project 
As mentioned in the initial definition, cloning downloads the complete source code to the local system. Going through below will help us understand step by step why and how we clone a repository.
Contribute to Organizational Projects:  A centralized system is required for organizations where multiple people work on the same code base. Cloning helps to achieve this motive. By cloning, people can edit the project code to either fix some issue or provide some modifications i.e. an extra or extended feature. This definitely helps in producing better software in less time with greater collaboration.
Make use of Open Source Repositories:  If someone wants to use some functionality which has already been developed by someone else, then why code it from scratch and waste time & resources when there are unlimited open source repositories that are available and can be modified which may directly fit into the projects.  
The cloning process works in these steps:
•	Clone a Repository: The user starts from the upstream repository in Git. Since the user navigated to the repository because he/she is interested in the concept and they like to contribute. The process starts from cloning the repository into their local master. Now they have the exact copy of the project files on their system to make the changes.
•	Make the desired changes: After cloning, contributors provide their contribution to the repository. Contribution in the form of editing the source files resulting in either a bug fix or adding functionality or maybe optimizing the code. But the bottom line is, everything happens on their local system.
•	Pushing the Changes back to the Original Repository: Once the changes are done, the modifications can be pushed to the upstream repository. 
Note: Owner of the repository can allow/disallow direct changes to Central Repository, set various notifications (It could be notification for any change pushed to central Repository)

Added a Repository image: 



Instead of using a single server-side repository to act as the “central” codebase, forking gives every developer a server-side repository. This means that each contributor has not one, but two Git repositories: a private local one and a public server-side one.
        
        
**Branch**:
A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process discussed in Git Basics, the first module of this series. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.


        **Commit**: 
        Commit implies telling Git to track the first change.

Merge
Checkout
Push
Pull 
Remote Add / Remove / Show
Status
Master Branch



The trick with this assignment it not to have a lot of text to commit you want small commits like one definition at t a time.  You have to think 2 things:
You just want to have to edit a little bit of text to resolve a merge conflict
You don’t want merge conflicts and you avoid merge conflicts by not having the same text on a line
The basic steps are

Create a repo
Everyone clones to their clocks
Create a branch for the task / definition
On your local do a commit on the Branch
Push to the branch to GitHub
Create a pull request for the branch to be merged
Merge the branch to master
Everyone pulls the master branch
Repeat for the next tasks
You will need to add all team members to the repo using the settings menu so everyone can push

Notes you can also fork a repo to your own and then clone and this makes it so you don’t have to add everyone to the main repo.  But when you create a pull request you got to click this link that says “compare across forks” so you can pick out branches from other forks
